"""Tests for the documented claim about running with no clock.

The documentation states:

    "in the absence of a clock, the sequencer cannot run, but the digital
     input bus values can still be set to constants or connected to
     digital input pins"

That is a promise to a project designer who does not need a clock at all:
an analog block being characterised over a DC sweep still needs its
digital control bits set, its supplies switched on and its biases routed,
and none of that should require driving clk.

The claim is exercised incidentally all over this suite -- test_analog,
test_bias, test_router, test_spi and test_sram never drive clk_in at all,
which is 50-odd tests' worth of evidence.  But being exercised by
accident is not the same as being asserted:  nothing in the suite says the
claim out loud, so nothing would notice if some of that quietly acquired
a clock dependency.  This file says it out loud, in both directions:

  - everything except the sequencer and pattern generator works with
    clk held at 0, including the SPI, the register file, the SRAM, both
    directions of the crossbar, project selection and all the analog
    switching;
  - the sequencer and pattern generator are frozen, not merely slow.

WHY THE SPI AND SRAM STILL WORK.  The register file is clocked from SCK,
which the SPI master supplies, and sram_clk is muxed to SCK whenever the
sequencer is stopped (see test_clocking.py).  So a project can load a
pattern into memory with no chip clock present -- it just cannot play it
back.

WHAT DOES NEED A CLOCK, beyond the two generators:  proj_reset is
synchronised to clk in user_project_control, and proj_clk is the gated
clock itself.  Those are not part of the claim and are covered in
test_project_control.py.
