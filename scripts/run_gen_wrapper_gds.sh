# NOTE:  This script used to run on caravel_openframe.  That layout no
# longer exists, and there is no reason to create a GDS file of the
# equivalent chipalooza_frame layout because it is not integrated into
# a "caravel"-like system.  So this file is repurposed to generate
# the GDS of each of the user area slots in chipalooza_frame.

# Run this script from the top level directory
#
# This is a compositor designed to do the following:
# (1) Source the scripts for reading layout with correct paths
# (2) Read each layout "slotN_wrapper", for N = 1 to 18
# (3) Write GDS of the slot wrapper into the ../gds directory
#
